# It's a project to create my own qq robot. Maybe used for developing a good study habit.

### 1. Introduction
Framework "Ariadne" is used in this project.
With the help of this framework, I could easily use python to write plugins to handle QQ messages.

### 2. Tell me what you want this qq robot to do, and I will devote my time to it.

### 3. TODO list

- [ ] learn the framework deeply
- [ ] create a function to async reply each "@" message
